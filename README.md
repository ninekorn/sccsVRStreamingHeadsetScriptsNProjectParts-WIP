# sccsVRStreamingHeadsetScriptsNProjectParts-WIP
 simple project to bring a pc screen capture from windows 10 to ubuntu or ubuntu to ubuntu WIP. I am not done yet with the buffer. But providing you have 2 computers with ubuntu or 1 with ubuntu and 1 with windows, starting my solution sccoresystems username 9 and password std, you can load the python scripts from here https://github.com/ninekorn/Python-2-way-local-network-communication-WIP (don't forget to open ports on ufw but on windows it worked right away with windows firewall).
