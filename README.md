# sccsVRStreamingHeadsetScriptsNProjectParts-WIP
Simple project to bring a pc screen capture from windows 10 to ubuntu or ubuntu to ubuntu WIP. I am not done yet with the buffer to take what is from c# and have python send it to ubuntu. But providing you have 2 computers with ubuntu or 1 with ubuntu and 1 with windows, starting my solution sccoresystems username 9 and password std, you can load the python scripts from here https://github.com/ninekorn/Python-2-way-local-network-communication-WIP on the server and client (don't forget to open ports on ufw but on windows it worked right away with windows firewall) and then merging both server script (sccsLocalNetWorkPcToPi.py) with the script sccsLNLPcToPi.py in this projects solution, and use the client script (sccsLocalNetWorkPiToPc.py) on a ubuntu installation or other windows installation, providing you have python installed, and if you have ST7735 screens or similar screens lying around, your dream of a Streaming VR pc headset is almost there. good luck people ;)
